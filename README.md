# xanthos
Xanthos is a Python package designed to quantify and analyse global water availability historically and in the future at 0.5° × 0.5° spatial resolution and a monthly time step.  Its performance and functionality was tested through real-world applications. It is open-source, extensible and accessible for researchers who work on long-term climate data for studies of global water supply, and the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM). This package integrates inherent global gridded data maps, I/O modules, hydrologic processes and diagnostics modules parameterized by a user-defined configuration file.
